6479,US,"Sourced from the Dineen Vineyard in the Rattlesnake Hills, this pure Cabernet sports generous plum and berry flavors that are lushly coated in dark notes of espresso, cacao and licorice. There is an underpinning of rock, adding structure and suggesting that this wine could be cellared for another decade.",Red Satin,90,39.0,Washington,Washington,Paul Gregutt,Palouse 2009 Red Satin Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),Cabernet Sauvignon,Palouse
6480,France,"This plump, medium-bodied blend of Grenache blanc, Roussanne, Viognier, Clairette and Bourboulenc features notes reminiscent of ginger, nectarine and melon, then finishes with fresh, zesty citrus.

Good acidity helps balance out the powerful concentration and sword's edge of alcohol, before finishing fresh and with length.",Reserve Bacigalupi,91,68.0,California,Russian River Valley,Virginie Boone,Matrix 2013 Reserve Bacigalupi Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Matrix
6482,France,"Full of the fresh acidity of the 2014 vintage, this light, bright wine has refreshing lemon and crisp apple flavors that are given richness by the lively acidity.

6483,Italy,"Aromas of peach blossom, red berry and sunbaked earth waft out of the glass. The luminous fruity palate doles out juicy raspberry, red cherry and a hint of Mediterranean herb while a white almond note gives it a pleasantly bitter close.",Tenuta Paraida,88,15.0,Southern Italy,Copertino,Kerin O’Keefe,Marulli 2016 Tenuta Paraida Rosato (Copertino),Rosato,Marulli

6485,Argentina,"This is your quintessential New World Best Buy. The bouquet is full, slightly oaky and a touch burnt, and overall it's very nice. Same goes for the mouth, full of ripe berry and cassis flavors. It's medium to full in terms of weight and intensity, while the tannins create a chewy, masculine sensation.",Henry Lagarde Reserve,89,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Michael Schachner,Lagarde 2005 Henry Lagarde Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Cabernet Sauvignon,Lagarde
6486,France,"This full-bodied wine just lacks that bit of freshness that would've taken it to the next level.

6488,France,"An equal blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a crisper than other Champagnes in the Coutelas range. It is also still young with its bright green and citrus fruits and tense texture.

6489,US,"This wine leaps out of the glass with fresh and bright aromas of strawberry blossoms, ripe raspberries, red flowers and a tiny bit of iron. The flavors are reminiscent of a potpourri satchel, with dried hibiscus flowers, tart cranberries, sour cherries and touches of pencil lead.",,88,20.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Matt Kettmann,Windrun 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),Pinot Noir,Windrun

6494,Chile,"Strikingly pungent on first take, with crackling aromas of cactus, nettle, lime and grapefruit. Feels zesty, deep and layered, with an even mix of tropical fruit flavors, stone fruits and green notes. About as right as it gets for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc.",EQ Coastal,91,20.0,Casablanca Valley,,Michael Schachner,Matetic 2011 EQ Coastal Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Matetic
6495,France,"The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there.

6496,US,"Blueberry, spices, fruitcake, even a maple syrup note mark the nose of this fairly sweet Zinfandel. The somewhat candied quality to the berry fruit was not favored by all tasters, but the plush yet structured mouthfeel has significant appeal. Dark sweet-tart fruit and moderate, even tannins work together to provide a positive finish.",Rustridge Vineyard,87,18.0,California,Napa Valley,,Rosenblum 1998 Rustridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),Zinfandel,Rosenblum
6497,US,"Mexican lime, crushed chalk, light jasmine, daffodil and lemon-lime soda show on the nose of this bottling by veteran Steve Dooley.

6498,Argentina,"Bold, jumpy, reduced aromas of plum and berry fruits show little to no oak.
